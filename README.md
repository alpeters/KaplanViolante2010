# Kaplan Violante 2010
## Final project for ECON 516

This code replicates Kaplan & Violante (2010). While some of the details in the paper are sparse, I have tried to follow the same methods as much as possible. In particular, the discretization method of the non-stationary income process is unclear. I followed the Rouwenhorst method for non-stationary processes outlined in Fella, Gallipoli, & Pan (2019). I built this on top the [QuantEcon.jl](https://github.com/QuantEcon/QuantEcon.jl) package discretization functionality and intend to contribute it when ready.

## Results
[Insert Figure]

## Data
The data required was obtained as follows:
* PSID mortality info from from NCHS 1992 data (Chung 1994)
* Life-cycle earnings profile from PSID data up to 1992 (Huggett, Ventura, & Yaron 2006)

## Methods
* Rouwenhorst non-stationary discretization
*

## Derivations
# First order conditions
$$ Y_{i t} =  \exp( \kappa_t + z_{i t} + \varepsilon_{i t})$$
$$ z_{i t} = z_{i,t-1} + \eta_{i t} $$
